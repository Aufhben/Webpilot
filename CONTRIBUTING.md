## Code Contributions
---
Before writing any code, please read the

* [Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) are our favorite channel for code contributions and the quickest way to get your fix or feature upstreamed and released. Here's a quick guide.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [Webpilot](https://github.com/webpilot-ai/Webpilot) repo

2. Keep your repo [synced](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) with the upstream to ensure smooth progress (i.e. that your changes do not interfere or conflict with someone elses's work). For new features or libraries, create a new branch with a descriptive name. See the mentioned [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for details.

3. Write the code changes; make sure they compile

4. Write the tests (if applicable, and it is in most cases); make sure they pass

5. Test your changes (preferably at least on major platforms - Linux, Windows, Mac)

6. Send [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a descriptive and clear commit message

At this point, it's our turn; if you've done everything well, we may just thank you and merge your request. Otherwise, we may provide some comments or suggestions to steer the contribution in the right direction.

## Contributing Mini-FAQ
---
**Q:** Is there any type of contributing license agreement that I have to sign to contribute new features to Fluentify?

**A:** Currently, you are not required to sign a contributing license agreement. What we require is that you put all your contributions under the [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Also, you are requested, for reasons of maintaining consistency, to assign the copyright to **"Webpilot.ai"**, by putting the corresponding license header in your source file (see the existing source files). 

---

**Q:** How can I get write access to the Git repository?

**A:** For simplicity purposes, we keep the direct write access to the main repository within a small group of core contributors. Since git forks , merges and pull requests are very easy and simple, this was not an obstacle so far. If you believe you really, really need write access to main repo, please contact the project maintainers at github@fluentify.io.
