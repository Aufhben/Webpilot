# To those who are confused about the "unverified" status in the ChatGPT Plugin.
There's no need to worry, it's just a plugin update that is currently pending review.

I submitted an updated version of the WebPilot's ChatGPT Plugin Thusday, which makes it faster, more accurate, and more powerful. According to ChatGPT's rules, plugin updates require a version review, which typically takes around 3 business days to complete. During the review process, the plugin will be marked as unverified and new users won't be able to install it (existing users are unaffected and can already use the more powerful new version in advance).

# Webpilot

Webpilot is a free, open-source "Copilot for web" that allows you to have free-form conversations with web pages or engage in automatic arguments with other users. Unlike ChatGPT, there is no need to chat or switch pages, and no need to constantly copy and paste back and forth. 

The current version of Webpilot is developed based on gpt-3.5-turbo, which binds some common prompts with shortcut commands, requests API, and displays results to manipulate the selected text on the webpage.
